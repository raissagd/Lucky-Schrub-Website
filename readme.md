This is the **final graded assessment from the fourth course of the Certificated Professional Front-End developer journey (there are 9 in total), by Meta.**

*In this course, I used software development tools like HTML to build attractive web pages that work well—, and used structured semantic data to control how websites appear to the end user. I also dived deeper into CSS by applying increasingly specific styling to various elements. I learned to use Bootstrap’s grid system to create layouts and work with components and themes. Finally, I explored debugging and learn how it can be utilized to banish common front-end errors.*

This project was entirely **self-made** and needed to get the course certificate. Therefore, the design lacks a bit of UX, since I created it solely on my own, and didn't want it to be too complex.
The purpose of this graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of this course. And what better way to do that than by applying your newly-learned skills in a practical way? I had to develop a home page for one of the four fictional proposed clients.

The one I chose was: Lucky Schrub.
*Based in Tuscon, Arizona, Lucky Shrub is a medium-sized garden design firm that specializes in garden design and creation, maintenance and landscaping. The company also runs a small plant nursery that sells indoor and outdoor plants, making them a one-stop shop for clients to "transform any space into an oasis you can be proud of".
Lucky Shrub was started by a husband and wife team, Jason and Maria, who share a long-time love for plants. Jason is the garden architect. He creates and oversees all designs while managing his team of landscapers. Maria manages all the marketing for the company and oversees the nursery.*
